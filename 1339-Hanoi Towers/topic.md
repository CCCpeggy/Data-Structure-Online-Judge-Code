There are three towers and N disks of different diameters placed on the first tower. The disks are in order of decreasing diameter as one scans up the tower. Monks were supposed to move the disks from tower 2 to tower 1 obeying the following rules:


(a) only one disk can be moved at any time.
(b) no disk can be placed on top of a disk with smaller diameter.
